Playing
-------
Starting a game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
anchor:XStart[]First, you must start a new game by clicking on menu 'New'.

At any time you can:

* click on the 'New' button to start a random new game (not played yet),
* click on the 'Replay' button to restart the current game,
* click on the 'Seed' button and enter a game number to start a given game,
* click on the 'Lost' button start a random game among thoses that have already
been lost.

Note: In all these cases the current game in progress if any is considered as
lost and counted as such.

The three areas and what can go where
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Playing area
This area is the whole bottom (all but the first row) of the screen.
There are 4 columns of 7 cards and 4 columns of 6 cards.

At start-up all the 52 cards are randomly placed in the playing area.

anchor:XStackingRule[]
Stacking rule: You can append a card at the bottom of a column providing that the new card is
one level below the bottom card (e.g. Jack on Queen) and that the new card is
of different color (in term of black and red) from the previous.

In an empty column you can put any card you want then stack several cards as
long as they respect the above xref:XStackingRule[stacking rule] of
decrescent levels and alternative colors.

.Foundations
Theses are the 4 decks, two at the top left (Hearts and Spades) and two at
the top right (Diamonds and Clubs) of the top row.

At start-up they show their target color.

Here you must place the cards, one color per deck, in the order
Ace, two, three..., Queen, Kind.

*The goal of the game is to move all the cards in the target foundation decks.*

.Free cells
These are the four places in the midlle of the top row.

They are highlighed with a light green border.

Here you can temporary put one card at a time in each free cell.

Moving the cards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You move the cards one by one, from any area to any area except that you cannot
move a card back from the target area.

* Select a card to move by left clicking on it. It becomes selected (its
background becomes grey). You can de-select it by clicking back on the card.
* Once a card is selected, select the destination by clicking on the
location. Valid destinations are indicated by a vertical arrow &#8657; when
the mouse cursor moves on it.

Note: An Ace that appears at the bottom of a row automatically moves at its
destination in its foundation. At the beginning of the game this triggered by
the first card movement.

Shortcuts
~~~~~~~~~
anchor:XShortcut[]You can double left click or middle click on a non selected
card to move it in a free cell if any is available.

You can left click on a non selected card to move it to its foundation (if
possible).

Once a card of the playing area is selected you can left click on an empy column
to move as many cards as possible from the selected colomn to the new one.
The cards move as if you moved them one by one, so the amount of cards moved
depends on:

* how many cards are following the xref:XStackingRule[stacking rule],
* how many empty columns and free cells can be used for temporary storage.

Undo and redo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can undo as many movements as you want (up to the beginning of the game),
and redo any movements undone.

Doing a movement clears the list of movements that can be re-done.

Score
~~~~~
anchor:XScore[] You can see you score by clicking on the 'Score' button. This
shows the statistics and scores since the game installation:

* Wins: the total number of games won

a game
* Wins percentage: percentage of games won among all played
* Defeates percentage: percentage of games lost among all played
* Continuous wins: number of continuous (successive) games won
* Continuous defeats: number of continuous (successive) games lost
* Undos: number of undo performed and not re-done.

- incremented by '10 + NbContinuousWins' each time a game is won,
- decremented by '10 + NbContinuousLost' each time a game is lost,
- decremented by '1' for each undo that is not re-done.
