Xfreecell
=========
Pascal MALAISE <malaise@magic.fr>
V7.04
:toc:

The goal of the game is to move all the cards from the bottom part of the
screen (eight columns) to the two top right and two top left foundation decks.

Installation
------------
anchor:XPrerequisits[]

Prerequisits::
In order to compile xfreecell you need:

* the gnu C\++ compiler g++, 
* gnu make, 
* the X11 development package libx11-dev (or devel),
* the XPM development package libxpm-dev (or devel),
* the X11 extensions development package libxext-dev (or devel) for
the round corners of cards and for the cursor shape indicating valid
xref:XDestinations[destinations] of cards.
If this package is not available you need to remove the '-DSHAPE' compilation
option from the makefile, and the '-r' option becomes not supported.

+
Optionnally you need the tool 'asciidoc' to generate the html
xref:XDoc[documentation].

Documentation::
anchor:XDoc[]Xfreecell comes with a man page xfreecell.6 and this asciidoc
document Xfreecell.txt. The Xfreecell.html document is automatically
generated together with the xref:XComp[compilation] if asciidoc is installed.

Compilation::
anchor:XComp[]In xfrecell directory launch:

 make
+
This has the effect of:

* in 'ms-compatible' directory compile 'convert.c' and launch 'convert'
that generates 'MSNumbers.h' from the binary database 'MSNumbers' of Microsoft
seed numbers,
* compile cpp sources in directory 'widget' and make an archive 'libwidget.a',
* compile cpp sources in current xfreecell directory and link xfreecell,
* generate the html documentation if possible (if 'asciidoc' is installed).
//////
//////

Installation::
In xfrecell directory launch:

 make install
+
NOTE: You may need to be root for this (or use sudo).
+
This installs xfreecell binary in DESTDIR/bin, xfreecell man page in
DESTDIR/man/man6 and Xfreecell.html (if any) in DESTDIR/share/xfreecell.
+
Default DESTDIR is /usr/local but you can change it by launching:

  make install DESTDIR=<your_dest_dir>

Clean-up::
You can clean the result of compilation and generated documentation with:

  make clean

Options
-------
anchor:XOptions[]
The environment variable HOME is used to define the directory
$\{HOME\}/.xfreecell where are saved the current configuration (options), 
scores and saved game. Default directory is "./.xfreecell".

The following options can be provided in the command line:

  -a | --animation for animation of card movements (default is yes)
  -s | --speed to set time in ms for each simple move of a card (default is 100)
  -m | --ms-seed for comptibility with microsoft seed generator (default is no)
  -q | --query-window for a popup window for single or multiple cards move (default is no).
       See the section on shortcuts for the discution on single/multiple cards movements.
  -p | --auto-play for automatic move of cards to the foundations (default is yes)
  -r | --round-card for sharp corner of cards, if xfreecell is compiled with -DSHAPE, (default is yes)
  -l | --load to load at start-up a game previouly saved (default is no)
  -d | --double-click to set the max delay in ms for a double click, from 100 to 900 (default is 500)

Each boolean option can be followed by "Y", "YES", "N" or "NO" in any casing,
otherwise "yes" is assumed.

--------------------------------
Example:
xfreecell -a no -s 100 -r N -m Y -q yes -p no -l
--------------------------------

These preferences (except '-r | --round-card' and '-l | --load') can also be
set in the xref:XPref[Pref] menu.

These preferences (except '-l | --load'), either set by command line option or
by the xref:XPref[Pref] menu, are saved in the persistent file
$\{HOME\}/.xfreecell/prefs.

For each option, xfreecell defines the value according to the following
criteria:

1. The one modified in the xref:XPref[Pref] menu,
2. Otherwise, the option provided in the command line, if any,
3. Otherwise, the value retrieved from the previous execution of xfreecell,
if any,
4. Otherwise the default value defined above.

Playing
-------
Starting a game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
anchor:XStart[]First, you must start a new game by clicking on menu 'New'.

At any time you can:

* click on the 'New' button to start a random new game (not played yet),
* click on the 'Replay' button to restart the current game,
* click on the 'Seed' button and enter a game number to start a given game,
* click on the 'Lost' button start a random game among thoses that have already
been lost.

NOTE: In all these cases the current game in progress, if any, is considered as
lost and counted as such. Same if you close the main window (through the window
manager).

The three areas and what can go where
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Playing area
This area is the whole bottom (all but the first row) of the screen.
There are 4 columns of 7 cards and 4 columns of 6 cards.

At start-up all the 52 cards are randomly placed in the playing area.

anchor:XStackingRule[]
[underline]#Stacking rule:# You can append a card at the bottom of a column
providing that the new card is one level below the bottom card (e.g. Jack on
Queen) and that the new card is of different color (in term of black and red)
from the previous.

In an empty column you can put any card you want then stack several cards as
long as they respect the above xref:XStackingRule[stacking rule] of
decrescent levels and alternative colors.

.Foundations
Theses are the 4 decks, two at the top left (Hearts and Spades) and two at
the top right (Diamonds and Clubs) of the top row.

At start-up they show their target color.

Here you must place the cards, one color per deck, in the order
Ace, two, three..., Queen, Kind.

*The goal of the game is to move all the cards in the foundation decks.*

.Free cells
These are the four places in the midlle of the top row.

They are highlighed with a light green border.

Here you can temporary put one card at a time in each free cell.

Moving the cards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You move the cards one by one, from any area to any area, except that you cannot
move a card back from the foundation area (but you can undo any move).

* Select a card to move by left clicking on it. It becomes selected (its
background becomes grey). You can de-select it by clicking back on the card.
* Once a card is selected, select the destination by left clicking on the
location. Valid anchor:XDestinations[] destinations are indicated by a vertical
arrow *&#8657;* when the mouse cursor moves on it (if xfreecell has been
compiled with option '-DSHAPE', see section on
xref:XPrerequisits[prerequisits]).

The cards are moved automatically to the foundation if all the following
conditions are fulfilled:

- the "auto-play" mode is activated,
- the movement is valid,
- this does not generate more than one level of difference between the colors 
in the foundations. For example, if the smalest red (Heards or Diamonds) on top
of its foundation is the 7, then not more than the 8 of blacks (Clubs and
Spades) will be automatically moved in the foundations.

NOTE: At the beginning of the game, or just after switching back to auto-play
mode, it is necessary to do a first movement in order to trigger the automatic
move of cards to the foundations.

Shortcuts
~~~~~~~~~
anchor:XShortcut[]You can double left click or middle click on a non selected
card to move it in a free cell if any is available.

You can left click on a non selected card to move it to its foundation (if
possible), otherwise move it to a free cell (if any).

Once a card of the playing area is selected you can right click on another
column to move as many cards as possible from the selected colomn to the new
 one.
The cards move as if you moved them one by one, so the amount of cards moved
depends on:

* how many cards are following the xref:XStackingRule[stacking rule],
* how many empty columns and free cells can be used for temporary storage.

NOTE: The automatic move fills the free cells and then the free columns with one
card each, then stacks these cards on the last column fed, then do it again
until all the columns are full, and then fills each free cell, which is not
optimal. +
For example, with 2 free columns and one free cell, the automatic move will put
3 cards in the first column, then 2 cards in the second column, then 1 card in
the free cell, allowing to move 7 cards altogether. +
A better strategy would be to put 2 cards in the first column, 2 cards in the
second column, move the 2 first cards in the second column, move 2 cards in
the first column, then 1 card in the free cell, allowing to move 8 cards
altogether.

Undo and redo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can undo as many movements as you want (up to the beginning of the game),
and redo any movements undone.

Doing a movement clears the list of movements that can be re-done.

Other buttons
-------------

Score
~~~~~
anchor:XScore[] You can see you score by clicking on the 'Score' button. This
shows the statistics and scores since the game installation:

* Wins: the total number of games won
* Defeats: the total numbner of games lost (see note on xref:XStart[starting]
a game
* Wins percentage: percentage of games won among all played
* Defeates percentage: percentage of games lost among all played
* Continuous wins: number of continuous (successive) games won
* Continuous defeats: number of continuous (successive) games lost
* Undos: number of undo performed and not re-done.
* Total score. This score is:
- incremented by '10 + NbContinuousWins' each time a game is won,
- decremented by '10 + NbContinuousLost' each time a game is lost,
- decremented by '1' for each undo that is not re-done.

These statistics are saved from one session to another in the file 
$\{HOME\}/.xfreecell/score.

Save
~~~~
anchor:XSave[]This button saves the current game (in a file named 
$\{HOME\}/.xfreecell/saved). +
The stacks of movements (for undo and redo) are not saved. +
