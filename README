====INSTALL====
<Source distribution>
Make sure there is a font named 7x14. If you don't like round-corner
cards or don't have the shape extension, delete -DSHAPE from the
makefile. You need g++ 2.8.1 or higher.

1. make
2. make install (you may need to be root to do this)

<Binary distribution>
You need to be root.

1. mv xfreecell /usr/local/bin
2. mv xfreecell.6 /usr/local/man/man6

Then if you want to use MS Freecell compatible seed number feature,
you must download MSNumbers from my homepage and move it to the 
directory specified in ./xfreecell/msNumPath.

====CONTROL====
<Mouse>
Double click: Moves the card to freecell. Same as windows.

Button2: Same as Double click. Recommended for 3-button mouse owners.
         Eases the load of your finger.

Button3(card): Moves the card to foundation.

Button3(empty pile): Moves multiple cards to the empty pile.

You can know other controls intuitively.

Note: There are two modes to move multiple cards to an empty pile. One
      is to use Button3 stated above. The other is to use query window
      which asks 'Single or Multiple'. The default is Button3 mode. To 
      use query window mode, press pref->toggle query->press Ok. Or 
      start xfreecell with option '-q'.

====BUTTONS====
New: Begin a new game randomly. Previously played games excluded.
Replay: Replay last game.
Seed: Begin a new game which corresponds to the number you typed.
Lost: Replay a lost game selected randomly.
Undo: Do undo.
Score: Display score.
Pref: Preference.
About: About.
Exit: Exit.

====ABOUT SEED====
From version 1.0.4, you can seed a game. But there is no guarantee 
about the uniqueness. If you hit upon an algorithm which guarantees
the uniqueness, please send me. I'm currently using the algorithm
of Microsoft Freecell (see mshuffle.txt).

Instead of using srand() and rand() in libc, I use NSsrand() and
NSrand() I implemented to make the seed numbers compatible over
many Unices. If you want to use srand() and rand(), remove -DBOGUSRANDOM
from makefile.

The check whether you played or not is not done in different seed-num
modes. That is, if you played a game in MS-seed-num mode, you may play
the same game in original-seed-num mode. But the possibility is very
low because there are too many games and there are only 32000 games in
MS-seed-num mode.

To play MS-seed-num mode, start xfreecell with option '-m' or toggle
'MS Seed' in pref.
