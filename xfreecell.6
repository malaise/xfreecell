default is false. Toggling 'MS Seed' in pref has the same effect.
.TP
\fB-q | --query-window\fP
Query window mode. In this mode, query window pops up when both
single and multiple cards movement is possible. The default is
false. Toggling 'Query' in pref has the same effect.

No round cards. Shape extension is heavy, so this option will speed up
the game.
.TP
\fB-s | --speedup \fIspeed\fR

is 100.
.TP

Display the version.

.SH CONTROL
.TP
\fBDouble Click\fP
Moves the card to freecell. Same as windows.

.SH ABOUT SEED
From version 1.0.4, you can seed a game. But there is no guarantee 
about the uniqueness. If you hit upon an algorithm which guarantees
the uniqueness, please send me. I'm currently using the algorithm
of Microsoft Freecell (see mshuffle.txt).

Instead of using srand() and rand() in libc, I use NSsrand() and
NSrand() I implemented to make the seed numbers compatible over
many Unices. If you want to use srand() and rand(), remove -DBOGUSRANDOM
from makefile.

The check whether you played or not is not done in different seed-num
modes. That is, if you played a game in MS-seed-num mode, you may play
the same game in original-seed-num mode. But the possibility is very
low because there are too many games and there are only 32000 games in
MS-seed-num mode.

To play MS-seed-num mode, start xfreecell with option '-m' or toggle 'MS Seed'
in pref.
